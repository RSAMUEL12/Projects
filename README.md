# Visualisation Projects

These are visualisation projects that I have completed both within my free time and during my academic career.

**Visualisations Available**
1. Kinetic Theory - a model to showcase how gas molecules are affected when properties change.
2. Company Reviews - a chart to display overall satisfaction from employees of the biggest tech companies.
