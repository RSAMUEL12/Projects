# Visualisation of the Kinetic Theory of Gas Molecules #

NOTE: The visualisation created uses the controlP5 library stored within the libraries folder of the processing sketchbook in order
to utilise user interaction with the visualisation.

### **INTRODUCTION** ### 
This visualisation showcases how gas molecules will act/interact within a container of a variable volume. It showcases the Kinetic
Theory of gas molecules within a container, which describes the random motion of molecules within a container due to its collisions and interactions within
the container itself.

Kinetic Theory can also explain behaviours of gas molecules in terms of pressure, temperature, and volume by considering their molecular properties of 
mass and velocity.

Within the visualisation, these behaviours can be exhibited by altering values for **temperature**, **mass of a molecule**, **velocity of a molecule**, and the **size of the container
(length, width, height)**.
By altering these values, the effects can be seen in the **Outputs** display on the right of the visualisation, presenting the **Pressure** and **Volume** values.

*NOTE: The units for each property:
Temperature: Kelvin
Mass: x 10^-26 kg
Volume: m^3
Pressure: Pascals
Velocity: m/s*

### **INTERACTING WITH THE VISUALISATION** ###
The visualisation can be interacted by using the *GUI sliders* to affect the model's/molecules' properties by sliding the mouse along its bar.

The *camera viewpoint* can also be changed by pressing and dragging the mouse from one part of the display to the other. The camera can zoom in using the mouse scroll
(scrolling up moves forward, scroll down moves backwards).

**WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE**
The purpose of the visualisation is to highlight the different relationships Kinetic Theory presents:
* Increasing Temperature increases the Kinetic Energy of each molecule, hence they move faster.
* Increasing Mass will decrease the velocity of the molecules since the K.E. stays the same so in order to be equal, velocity must decrease as mass increases to maintain the K.E.
* Increasing both mass and velocity will increase the Pressure exerted on the walls of the container because force is the measure of the change in momentum (mv).
* Increasing the container sizes will decrease the pressure because the surface area of the walls will increase but Pressure = Force / Surface Area so they are inversely proportional
